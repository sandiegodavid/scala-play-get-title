# Use Scala Play to get a page title

Using the [Play framework and Scala](Play framework and Scala), create a web form that allows a user to type in a url to any website and have it then output the Title of that website on the same page. For example, if I typed in CNN.COM, it would spit out "Breaking News, Daily News and Videos - CNN.com".

## How to run

Start the Play app:

```
$ ./activator run
```

And open [http://localhost:9000/pages](http://localhost:9000/pages)
